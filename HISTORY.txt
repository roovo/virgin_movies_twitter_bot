30 Mar 2009 - version 0.2
-------------------------

  * BUGFIX: ensure that all tweeted text is tidied
  * FEAT:   stricter film validation so tweets won't have bits missing in them
            if some data on the site is missing.
  * FEAT:   tweet text reads better (I think so anyway).
  * FEAT:   tweet all updates to film details unless it's only the number of 
            days left that has changed or unless there are 0 days left
